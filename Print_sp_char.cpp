// To print Special Characters in C / C++ We need to use a BackSlash( \ ) character before it, that way it will get printed as it is without getting used in the program.
// For example: To print a backslash we need to use \\ .
// To print a double quote we need to use \" .
// To print a new line character we need to use \\n .
// To print a tab character we need to use \\t .
// To print a form feed character we need to use \\f .
